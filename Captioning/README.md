# pytorch-image-captioning

## Abstract
In this project, I have implemented an end-to-end Deep Learning model for Image Captioning. The architecture consists of Encoder and Decoder Networks. Encoder is one of the pre-trained CNN architectures to get image embedding. Decoder is LSTM network with un-intialized word embeddings.

## Requirements
1. python3.6 
2. [pytorch](http://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu90/torch-0.4.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl) 
3. pytorch-vision 
4. pillow 
5. nltk  
6. pickle 
7. cuda version 9.0/9.1
8. cuDNN >=7.0

```bash
pip install http://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu90/torch-0.4.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl pytorch-vision pillow nltk pickle
```

## Dataset
[Flickr8K](http://www.jair.org/papers/paper3994.html) <br>
#train : 6000 <br>
#dev : 1000 <br>
#test : 1000 <br>

## Instructions to run the code

### 1. Pre-Processing
```bash
python3 Preprocess.py
```

### 2. Train 
```bash
python3 train.py -model <encoder_architecture> -dir <train_dir_path> -save_iter <model_checkpoint> -learning_rate <learning_rate> -epoch <re-train_epoch> -gpu_device <gpu_device_number> -hidden_dim <lstm_hidden_state_dim> -embedding_dim <encoder_output>
```
##### args:

 `-model`        :   one of the cnn architectures - alexnet, resnet18, resnet152, vgg, inception, squeeze, dense<br>
` -dir`          : training directory path<br>
` -save_iter`    : create model checkpoint after some iterations, default = 10<br>
` -learning_rate`: default = 1e-5<br>
` -epoch`        : re-train the network from saved checkpoint epoch<br>
` -gpu_device`   : gpu device number in case multiple gpus are installed on server<br>
` -hidden_dim`   : number of neurons for lstm's hidden state, default = 512<br>
` -embedding_dim`: output of cnn encode model, default = 512<br>


### 3. Test
```bash
python3 test.py -model <encoder_architecture> -i <image_path> -epoch <saved_model> -gpu_device <gpu_device_number>
```
##### args: 

` -i` : image path for generating caption <br>
 
 [Download trained model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xF8dfIDsz57ZrX7bKApOakyjm1GoelJm): Trained for ~24 hours (230 iterations) on single NVIDIA 1080 (8GB) GTX GPU. 
 
## Results
### Check whether the model is training or not by overfitting on small dataset.
![Screen Shot](train_pic.png)
Since training error is decreasing it seems like model is working just fine.

### Train vs validation loss
